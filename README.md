# Image Explorer

### The "Image Explorer" project enables users to effortlessly discover images based on specific categories or types. It utilizes React Query to retrieve data from the Unsplash images API, while Axios handles the transmission of HTTP requests to the server. To enhance code reusability and comprehension, React context concepts are employed, resulting in shorter and more intelligible code. Additionally, a dark theme option is available for users who prefer a darker screen mode. The theme toggle functionality is implemented using event listeners, and React state and custom hooks are leveraged throughout the project.

#### React concepts used :
<ul>
  <li> State Hook</li>
  <li> Custom hook</li>
  <li> React Query</li>
  <li> Axios to send HTTP requests .</li>
</ul>

### Useful VS code extensions used while making the project : Thunder Client
The Thunder client VS Code extension empowers users to effortlessly execute GET and POST requests with APIs. Additionally, it performs thorough checks to verify the operational status of the API and presents a comprehensible data structure showcasing the fetched information.
